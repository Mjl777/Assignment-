1. Installed PostgreSQL using the link “https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads”. 
2. I practiced the PostgresSQL using the cheat code and tried the codes psql postgres, \du, CREATE DATABASE, \l, \dn, CREATE ROLE role_name;, CREATE ROLE username NOINHERIT LOGIN PASSWORD password;
3. Installed it in my desktop directory, then I unchecked the stack builder and then added a password.
4. I practiced all the SQL queries you have learned.
5. I created a database called “dvdrental”, then restored the database, downloaded a zip file called “dvdrental” and then unzip it. After that I added the information in the restore database using the unzipped file called “dvdrental” and restored it.
6. I learned how to use the basic PostgreSQL SELECT statement to query data from a table.
